"I’m Winston Wolfe. I Solve Problems" — Winston Wolfe, Pulp Fiction

I am a methodical problem solver, no-nonsense communicator, and tactful diplomat. For the past decade I have led my colleagues consistently to success as the go-to engineer and hands-on architect.

My approach

I am a cloud-native platform engineer. I focus on open-source best practices and vendor-neutral solutions. My approach to architecture is lean, uncluttered, and minimalist so that it is easy for the whole team to manage. I use a divide-and-conquer style to break down complex backlogs into clear, actionable tasks. Any work I do creates tangible outcomes; code, diagrams, or documentation that ensure everyone knows exactly how to move forward.
