    <h2 class="cv-section-title">My approach</h2>

    <div class="cv-approach">
        <p>I am a cloud-native platform engineer. I focus on open-source best practices and vendor-neutral solutions. My approach to architecture is lean, uncluttered, and minimalist so that it is easy for the whole team to manage. I use a divide-and-conquer style to break down complex backlogs into clear, actionable tasks. Any work I do creates tangible outcomes; code, diagrams, or documentation that ensure everyone knows exactly how to move forward.</p>
